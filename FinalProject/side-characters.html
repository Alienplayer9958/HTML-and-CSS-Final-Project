        <h2>Side Characters</h2>
        <h3>
            Unlike Mya, everyone else in the village cannot see the magic. There are a few side characters that the player will interact with to restore the magic, however the villagers' lack of magic knowledge creates a challenge.
        </h3>

        <h2>Mali J. Harbor</h2>
        <h3>
            Mali is a 19-year-old with jet-black hair, a long face, and a boundless love for nature. Having grown up in Rosewood but free to explore its outskirts, she serves as Mya’s best friend and guide, helping her navigate the mysteries of magical plants and spirits.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Curious, intelligent, and empathetic, Mali has a knack for understanding both people and nature, making her an invaluable companion for uncovering secrets hidden in Rosewood. She encourages Mya to push boundaries and embrace the unknown, all while offering practical advice and a grounding perspective when challenges arise.
        </h3>

        <h2>Pyla</h2>
        <h3>
            Pyla is Mya’s loyal and clever pet fox, small enough to sneak into tight spaces yet agile enough to explore difficult terrain. Her origins are a mystery, but her bond with Mya is unwavering. Pyla is more than just a companion; she helps the player locate rare materials, retrieve lost objects, and assist in restoring magic to hidden or hard-to-reach areas. Her playful and curious nature adds lighthearted moments to the game, while her intelligence subtly guides Mya toward important discoveries.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Pyla’s loyalty extends beyond mere assistance. She has an innate connection to the spirits and magic of Rosewood, sensing disturbances in the environment and alerting Mya to hidden opportunities or dangers. Players will find that Pyla can also interact with certain creatures, clear obstacles, or trigger events that open new exploration paths. Her presence reinforces the themes of companionship and discovery, reminding players that magic is not only found in jewels and spells but also in the bonds formed along the journey.
        </h3>

        <h2>Mayor Thalric</h2>
        <h3>
            Mayor Thalric is the wise and slightly eccentric leader of Rosewood. Having witnessed the town’s decline in magic over decades, he carries a deep concern for the community and secretly hopes for someone to restore its vitality.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Though his outward demeanor is formal and sometimes intimidating, he is compassionate, valuing the welfare of villagers and the natural world alike. He serves as a quest-giver, providing challenges that gradually teach Mya about restoring magic to the town’s buildings, streets, and surrounding forests.
        </h3>
