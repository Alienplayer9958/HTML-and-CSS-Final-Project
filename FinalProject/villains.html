        <h2>Villains and Antagonists</h2>
        <h3>
            Throughout the long quest to save the world, the player will be faced with many villagers trying to stop them. The first of them being the blacksmith, an older man who has struggled with misfortune his whole life.
        </h3>

        <h2>Kael Ironhart</h2>
        <h3>
            Kael was once Rosewood’s most skilled blacksmith, known for forging tools and objects imbued with subtle magic. However, years of personal misfortune (failed business ventures, accidents, and betrayals by those he trusted) twisted his outlook.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            He grew bitter and isolated, convinced that the world is unjust and that magic should be controlled by those strong enough to seize it. In his bitterness, he begins sabotaging the village’s efforts to restore magic, tampering with plants, structures, and mystical relics to slow Mya’s progress.
        </h3>

        <h2>The Restless Spirits</h2>
        <h3>
            Scattered throughout Rosewood and the surrounding wilderness, certain spirits have grown hostile due to centuries of neglect or damage to their habitats. While many spirits aid Mya, these antagonistic spirits create environmental challenges, puzzles, or combat-like encounters that test the player’s skills in restoring magic.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Each spirit has its own personality and reason for aggression—some are protective of treasures, others are vengeful due to human interference, adding depth to the world and keeping exploration exciting.
        </h3>

        <h2>Thornshade, the Corrupted Plant</h2>
        <h3>
            A rare magical plant twisted by improper care or dark magic, Thornshade spreads corruption to nearby flora and soil. It serves as both a mini-boss and a puzzle antagonist, requiring the player to figure out which spells or tools will cleanse its influence. Thornshade introduces environmental hazards, limited-time challenges, and encourages players to think strategically about resource management and spell placement.
