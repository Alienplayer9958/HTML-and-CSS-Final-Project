        <h2>Main Character</h2>
        <h3>
            Meet the main character! Her name is Mya, she has plenty of hidden talents, skills, and abilities that the player can discover while playing the game! Mya is the character the player will play as throughout the storyline.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Mya is a curious and determined young adult who has always lived under the watchful eye of her affluent family. Despite a life of comfort and strict boundaries, she has an insatiable fascination with the natural world, particularly the hidden magic within flowers. Her days are spent tending to her flower shop, a quiet rebellion against her parents’ disapproval, where she nurtures both plants and her own sense of wonder.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            When she discovers a mysterious, magical flower, her life takes a turn, and she embarks on a journey that will challenge her intellect, courage, and creativity. Alongside her loyal pet fox, Pyla, and guided by the knowledge of earth spirits, Mya uncovers secrets of her grandfather’s magical past and discovers her own rare ability to restore life to the world around her.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Though Mya’s world was once small and controlled, she quickly adapts to the larger mysteries of Rosewood. She is both resourceful and compassionate, eager to befriend villagers, learn from spirits, and experiment with her newfound magical abilities. Her inquisitive nature drives her to explore abandoned paths, decipher ancient texts, and harness jewels to unlock spells that reshape her environment.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            With each challenge she faces, Mya grows more confident, creative, and connected to the natural and mystical world. Players step into her shoes not just to restore magic to a fading village, but to experience the joy of discovery, the warmth of friendship, and the quiet thrill of uncovering the secrets that have long been hidden in the heart of Rosewood.
        </h3>
